# Algorithms

Miscellaneous algorithms I've happened to implement.
---
this is a repository consisting of 
miscellaneous algorithms and data structures implementations.
Many of which probably will come from leetcode.com problem lists.


### MOST HELPFUL ALGORITHMS ARE LISTED HERE:
```python3
def superior_sort(array):
    while (is_sorted(array) == False):
        random.shuffle(array)
```
